Set represents a >Set< of elements:
    ~ Not allow repeat;
    ~ Elements have no position;
    ~ Access, insert and remove of elements is fast;
    ~ Offers efficient operations of set: intersection, union, difference;

* Main implementations:
    HashSet - Faster O(1) not ordered;
    TreeSet - Slower O(log(n)) ordered by object's compareTo (default is alphabetically);
    LinkedHashSet - Average speed ordered by input order;

* Relevant methods:
    add(obj), remove(obj), contains(obj)
    ~ based on equals and hashCode;
    clear(), size(), removeIf(predicate)

    addAll(other) - union: adds to the set other set elements, no repeat;
    retainAll(other) - intersection: remove set's elements that doesn't appear in other set;
    removeAll(other) - difference: remove of set all elements contained in other set;
